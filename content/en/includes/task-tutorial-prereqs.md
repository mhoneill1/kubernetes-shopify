Before you start, make sure you have the following:
* At least one Kubernetes cluster. If you don't already have a cluster, you can create one with
[minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tutorials/multi_node/),
or you can use one of these Kubernetes playgrounds:
  * [Killercoda](https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/kubernetes)
  * [Play with Kubernetes](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/)
* The kubectl command-line tool is configured to communicate with your cluster.

Note: We recommend running this tutorial on a cluster with at least two nodes that are not acting as control plane hosts.
